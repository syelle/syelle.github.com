<p>Early on in the exploration of analytics, it's easy to fall into the trap of focusing mostly on vanity metrics. Learning to move beyond this superficial data will help you discover how you can improve your site's performance.</p>

<h2>What are vanity metrics?</h2>
<p>Vanity metrics are metrics whose changes don't directly correlate to increased <abbr title="Favorable actions, whether they be direct product purchases or other significant events such as user registrations.">conversions</abbr>. While they might look pretty, they're only important at a very high level. If you focus on vanity metrics, you cannot answer the questions you need to answer to make sure your site is healthy.</p>

<p>Suppose I told you that my eCommerce storefront had 5% more unique visitors last month. At a very high level, that sounds great. Now, suppose I told you that revenue dropped 2% last month. Suddenly, it doesn't sound so good. Why am I making less money with more users?</p>

<p>Even focusing on overall revenue is dangerous. Suppose I said my storefront was making 5% more money. Cause for celebration? Not if I'd gained 50% more users during that period. Why did so many more users result in such a low increase in revenue?</p>

<p>Vanity metrics do have a purpose, however: they are the basic building blocks for more actionable metrics.</p>

<h2>What are actionable metrics?</h2>
<p>Actionable metrics answer specific questions about the performance of a site:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Am I making money on my marketing efforts?</li>
	<li>Where are visitors dropping off before they convert?</li>
	<li>Is there something I can do to make fewer users drop off?</li>
	<li>What is likely to cause users to convert at a higher rate?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these questions all focus not just on raw numbers, but attempt to get answers that can result in direct action to improve the site.</p>

<p>For example, say I discovered that only 5% of visitors registered an account on my site. This caused me to dive further into the entire sign-up process2. This told me that about 80% of people made it to my sign-up form but only just over 5% made it to email verification. Now, I know that there's something about my sign-up form that scared people off. Armed with that information, I could then <abbr title="Testing multiple versions of a page side-by-side by splitting visitors between the pages to see which one is most likely to convert a user.">split-test</abbr> different versions of that form to find one that causes a higher percentage of people to complete registration.</p>

<p>You'll have to dig deeper for actionable metrics than you do fr vanity metrics, but it's worth it. Fortunately, most modern web analytics solutions provide standard reports that help discover many common actionable metrics pretty quickly. For information that's specific to your organization, you can also create custom reports that you can refer back to for tracking the progress of important actionable metrics.</p>
